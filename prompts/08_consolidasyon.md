Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/SPEC.md`, and `docs/EXECPLAN.md`.

Do a post-phase consolidation pass only.

Scope:
- do not add new architecture layers
- do not add live capture or live input
- do not expand scope beyond documentation and cleanup

Tasks:
- update README.md so it reflects the current implemented architecture
- create docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md summarizing:
  - completed phases
  - implemented modules
  - still-placeholder areas
  - current safety guarantees
  - current limitations
  - how to run tests
- create a concise docs/NEXT_STEPS.md explaining what would be required to move from skeleton to real safe integrations
- ensure requirements.txt and pyproject.toml still match the current repo state
- provide a final validation report

Before finishing:
- run the pre-delivery self-debug loop
- keep changes documentation-only unless a tiny fix is required for consistency
- clearly separate actually executed checks from static reasoning
